# Steps to run the model
## Step 1: Clone the repo
Run `git clone https://github.com/Saad135/limo_gazebo_model.git`

## Step 2: Start Gazebo
Assuming gazebo is installed, Run `gazebo`. The picture below shows the gazebo UI.


## Step 3: Add model path

## Step 4: Load model
Select the model from the left pane and click once on the map. The cursor turns to a loading icon. Wait for the model to load (Might take a few seconds, since the mesh files are big).
